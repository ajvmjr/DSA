# DSA

Welcome to the **DSA** repository! This repository serves as a personal collection of manually implemented algorithms and solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I solve on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Store and document algorithms I have implemented manually, focusing on understanding the core concepts.
- Maintain a record of my LeetCode problem-solving journey, showcasing my solutions and thought processes.
- Serve as a reference for studying and improving my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Algorithms/**: Contains implementations of common algorithms like sorting, searching, merging, and more.
- **LeetCode/**: Includes solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by topic (e.g., strings, arrays, recursion, dynamic programming).

## Highlights

- Focused on clarity and readability to ensure easy understanding of each implementation.
- Solutions are optimized whenever possible, but also include initial attempts for learning purposes.
- Regular updates as I progress through new problems and concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajvmjr/DSA.git
   ```
2. Explore the folders to find specific algorithms or problem solutions.
3. Run the code locally to see the implementations in action.

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal learning and growth, but feel free to:

- Suggest improvements to existing solutions via pull requests.
- Open issues to discuss alternate approaches or optimizations.
